Databases & SQL

Databases- System for the storage and retrieval of organized information
	- I like to think about it like a Filing Cabinet

::USER -> APPS -> DATABASES

EX: 
Things that have to be stored in a Database for a Blog:
	- Posts (text, images, embedded content)
	- Authors / Users (thier role/permissions)
	- Comments
	- Tags & Categories
	- Avatars
	- Search history
	- Favorites

Relational Databases:
	- Stores data in Tables (basically... Excel spreadsheets)
	- Tables have Rows and Columns
	- Tables are related to each other through PRIMARY KEYS AND FOREIGN KEYS
	- A RECORD is a row in our Tables
	- Relationships between tables should be created and defined before any records are created


Ex: Construction Co.
	- Equipment Table and Service Table
	- PRIMARY KEY = ServiceID (unique identifier)
	- FOREIGN KEY = EquipmentID (creates relationship between the tables)
	- This is an exmaple of a "One To Many" Relationship

How do we interact with a relational Database?
	- SQL: Structured Query Language
		- SQL commands allows us to store, manipulate and retrieve data
		- SQL is the LANGUAGE used to interact with a Database

Databases have named themselves after SQL, which can be confusing
	- There's lots of flavors of relational Databases
		- Popular ones: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle(enterprise), Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite
		- All of these are relational databases and they all use the same SQL syntax
		- However, annoyingly, there is going to be some differences in semantics
