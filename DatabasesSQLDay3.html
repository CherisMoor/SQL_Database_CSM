SQL JOIN
	- A jOIN allows us to bring multiple tables together and return columns for each

	-2 Kinds of JOIN
		1.INNER
		2.OUTER (LEFT & RIGHT)
**We're mainly focus on the INNER and the LEFT OUTER JOIN, these are easily the most common (90%). RIGHT OUTER JOIN is pretty much the same as LEFT OUTER JOIN

-INNER JOIN: returns every record where the ON statement is true
-LeFT JOIN: returns every record from the base (or left) tableand every record from the joined table that matches the ON statement
-even if the JOIN brings no matches, a LEFT JOIN will return everything from the base table
